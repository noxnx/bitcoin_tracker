# **Bitcoin tracker**
**DISCLAIMER: I know that this is the most basic project that one can think of. But I wanted to get exposure to working with microcontrollers (specifically Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W).**

### **What this project is about**
By the end of this project I want:
- the current BTC/EUR price displayed on an LCD display
- retrieve the current BTC/EUR price with a Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W
- MAYBE create a 3d printed case to put the microcontroller and the display in (I will add the design file in this repository if I choose to do that)
